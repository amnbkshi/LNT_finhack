# LTFS Data Science FinHack - Loan Default Prediction
This repository contains the code for the hackathon (Data Science FinHack)[https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/ltfs-datascience-finhack-an-online-hackathon/]. I have used an ensemble of models and came in top 10%. The results could further be improving by applying more pre-processing to the data.

The problem is a classical financial problem in which we have to predict whethera give person will default on loan or not. On basis of the prediction companies decide whether to give loan to the person or not.
